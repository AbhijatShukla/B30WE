Differences in protocols:
HTTP 1 Protocol
• HTTP methods are Get, Put or Post.
• Request target such as URL or port is used.
• It uses text based commands for HTTP requests.
• It had official recognition in 1996.
• The new response headers allowed multiple file types e.g. plain text, HTML, images etc.
HTTP 1.1 Protocol
• It was released in 1997.
• It uses text based commands for HTTP requests.
• It added many performance enhancements e.g. caching, request pipelining, keepalive connections, transfer encoding, byte range requests etc.
• It can load one requests at a time. Hence one request per one TCP connection is possible.
HTTP 2 Protocol
• It was released in Feb. 2015 by IERF.
• It is binary and not textual.
• It is fully multiplexed.
• It interleaves multiple requests/responses in parallel without blocking on anyone.
• It uses single TCP connection to deliver multiple requests/responses (in parallel).
• It uses header compression in order to reduce overhead.
• It allows servers to "push" responses into client caches proactively.
• It removes unnecessary HTTP/1.x work-arounds e.g. Image sprites, domain sharing etc. • It is less error prone than HTTP/1.
